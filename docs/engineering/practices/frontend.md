# Frontend Practices

This document describes frontend coding conventions and habits.

## Principles

- Prefer explicit data flow over implicit magic.
- Keep screens thin and module-owned.
- Extract logic when duplication appears.

## Validation

- Shared schemas are preferred over duplicated validation.
- View models must be clearly distinguished from domain data.
