# Product Vision

Trena is a personal fitness application focused on structured tracking,
long-term progression, and user ownership of data.

## Principles

- Data correctness over convenience
- Long-term usability over short-term engagement
- Explicit structure over hidden behavior

## Non-Goals

- Social feeds or influencer-driven content
- Gamified engagement mechanics
- Short-term transformation framing
